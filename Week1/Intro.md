# What is MLOps?
Machine Learning engineering is not just about running experiments, but to realize its value in the real world scenarios. MLOps is a set of principles and practices for efficient management of end-to-end ML lifecycle from experiments to productionization.
  
MLOps -  
* enables version management of both data as well as model artifacts.
* operationalises the development and release cycle of ML models in CICD ecosystem
* helps to monitor the performance of models in production to maintain effectiveness
